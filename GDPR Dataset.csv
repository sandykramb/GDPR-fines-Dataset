During the investigation, the ICO found that Marriott had employed inadequate security check-ups on its systems after acquiring Starwood. Recently, the ICO decided to fine Marriott with £18.4 million (about EUR 20.4 million). When calculating this fine, the ICO took into consideration the company’s absence of prior violations of GDPR regulations, as well as the company’s full cooperation during the investigation, and personal initiative to notify the affected individuals regarding the data breach.</p>

This fraudulent website would harvest the customer details of all clients taken there. The personal data of more than 500,000 customers was harvested during the incident. During the ICO’s investigation, it was found that British Airways was mainly to blame for much of the compromised information, due to inadequate security measures, such as log-in, payment card, and travel booking details. The ICO eventually decided to lower the fine to £20 million (about EUR 22,046,000), taking into consideration the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the airline industry.</p>

The Italian Data Protection Authority (Garante) revealed that TIM was fined due to numerous unlawful data processing activities related to marketing and advertising, which included unsolicited promotional calls and prize competitions in which data subjects were entered without consent.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for the large fine was the fact that the unlawful data processing activities involved several million individuals. One individual, for example, was called a total of 155 times in a month while TIM refused to add the affected individual on a no-call list even after several requests. The DPA determined that the company lacked control over the call centers and did not have adequate measures to add people to no-call lists.</p>
<p>TIM also did not provide accurate and detailed enough privacy policies and data processing policies, and as such consumers were not efficiently informed about the data collected and processed. The company&#8217;s management of data breaches was also not efficient according to Garante.</p>
<p>Besides the fine, Garante also imposed 20 corrective measures according to Art. 58(2) GDPR which prohibits TIM from processing marketing-related data of those individuals who have refused to receive promotional calls, individuals who asked to be blacklisted and individuals who are not clients of TIM.</p>

Facebook argued that it did in fact appoint a data protection officer in Ireland who acted as a data protection officer for all the local European Facebook branches. The Data Protection Authority of Hamburg, however, argued that Facebook did not notify the German authority about this appointment, and as such, the fine is valid. The reason the fine was relatively small was that Facebook did, after all, appoint a DPO but failed to notify German authorities. The fine was given to Facebook Germany GmbH, which is the local German branch of the company.</p>
<p>The fine was issued sometimes in 2019 but was only made public by the Data Protection Authority of Hamburg in February 2020. The exact date of the fine was not revealed.</p>

Carrefour France also had insufficient and incomplete data regarding the data storage and transfer of data to countries outside the EU. The company also failed to comply with the storage time limits, and it stored the data of more than twenty-eight million customers who had been inactive for five to ten years, for the purpose of its loyalty program. The same happened to 750,000 users of the carrefour.fr site who were inactive for about five to ten years. The CNIL discovered that Carrefour France required almost every user to offer proof of identity when they requested a right. Though, the CNIL found out that this request for proof of identity was, most times, unjustified, because most affected users were clearly identifiable without the need for proof of identity. What’s more, Carrefour France failed to respond to a couple of requests from individuals who wanted to access their personal data.

The Hamburg data protection officer discovered that, since 2014, specific details about the lives of some employees of H&#038;M were comprehensively recorded and stored as information on a network drive. In one of these cases, the company devised a “Welcome Back Talk” after its employees had returned from a vacation or an illness. All the information that the company obtained during this time, including specific information about the illnesses and medical diagnoses of the employees, were retained and stored. The Hamburg data protection officer also found that the H&#038;M supervisors obtained general information about its employees “through the grapevine”, such as religious beliefs and family problems. All the information stored on the network drive was made accessible to over 50 managers of H&#038;M, and they used it to evaluate the work performance and efficiency of all employees, as well as make employment decisions. This fact became known when the H&#038;M servers encountered a technical error, and the data on the network drive became accessible to all employees for a few hours. The management subsequently apologized to all affected employees and offered monetary compensation in return for this offence.

However, the company was very cooperative with the data protection authority, so the fine was reduced from EUR 9,55 million to EUR 900,000. The culpability of the company was reasonably low to justify this decrease in the fine’s value, due to the fact that the company’s procedure of identifying customers through the hotline by asking only the name and date of birth wasn’t objected by any customer, so the company wasn’t aware of the problem this procedure posed. Moreover, the court of law deemed that this problem didn’t result in a massive data leakage.</p>

Back in May 2020, the Polish DPA was notified by a third party that a data breach occurred at Towarzystwo Ubezpieczeń i Reasekuracji WARTA S.A, regarding an insurance agent posing as a processing agent at the company. The insurance agent sent an insurance policy to an unauthorized third party via e-mail. The document contained personal data regarding the subject of the insurance policy, including first names, surnames, residential addresses, and other information. Then, the supervisory authority demanded that the company clarify whether it performed any risk analyses on the data security of natural persons, in connection to the electronic correspondence sent to an unauthorized third party, as this would make it evident that a data breach had occurred. If a data breach does occur, the company responsible is obligated to notify both the DPA and the affected parties. Despite being sent a letter by the supervisory authority asking for explanations on the data breach, the responsible party did nothing to report the data breach to the DPA or inform the affected data subjects about the data breach. Finally, the DPA initiated administrative proceedings, which eventually prompted the company to report the data breach and notify the two affected individuals about the incident.</p>
